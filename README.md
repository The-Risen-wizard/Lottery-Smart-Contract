# Lottery-Smart-Contract
It is a smart contract based on a lottery system which includes 3 or more than 3 players.
The players must be able to participate only after paying a fee of 0.1 ether.
The manager must be the owner of the contract and nly he should be able deploy it.
The only isuue I am facing in this smart contract is the "gas cost" which shows infinity at the random number generated function which is the second to last function in this smart contract.
After paying fees of 0.1 ether, the players must be able to partipate in the lottery system and the winner will be piced randomly.
